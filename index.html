				<li><h3>Frisbee Golf</h3></li>
					<ol>
						<p><strong>Objective: Disc golf is played the same way as traditional golf, the player with the fewest "strokes" wins the game.</strong></p>
						<li>Each hole begins with a tee throw. Tee throws must be completed within or behind the designated tee area.</li>

						<br>

						<li>The lie is the spot where the player’s previous throw has landed. Mark lie with a mini disc or turn over the thrown disc, directly towards the hole or designated fairway. The player’s subsequent throw is made from directly behind the marked lie.</li>

						<br>
						
						<li>The player with the least amount of strokes on the previous hole is the first to tee off on the next hole. After teeing off, the player whose disc is farthest from the hole always throws first.</li>

						<br>
						
						<li>Fairway throws must be made from directly behind the lie. A run-up and normal follow-through, after release, is allowed, unless the lie is within 11 yards of the target. Any shot within 11 yards of the target requires that the player not move past the lie until the disc is at rest.</li>

						<br>
						
						<li>A dogleg is one or more designated trees or poles in the fairway that must be passed as indicated by arrows. Until the dogleg is passed the closest foot to the dogleg must be on the lie when the disc is released.</li>

						<br>
						
						<li>A disc that comes to rest in the disc golf basket basket or chains constitutes successful completion of that hole.</li>

						<br>
						
						<li>Any disc that comes to rest above the ground is considered an unplayable lie. The disc must be thrown from the lie on the ground, directly underneath the unplayable lie, relocated to avoid damage to the vegetation.</li>

						<br>

						<li>If any area of O.B. is visible between the disc and O.B. line, then the disc is considered O.B. A throw that lands out of bounds, must be played from a point 3 feet in bounds from where the disc went out of bounds. Permanent water hazards and public roads are always out of bounds.</li>

						<br>

						<li>Recreational players will not be penalized for rule infractions. Other players will keep you honest.</li>

				<li><h3>Bocce Ball</h3></li>
					<ol>
						<p><strong>Objective: In each frame, only one team scores. One point is given for each bocce ball that is closer to the pallino than the opposing team’s bocce balls. The pallino distance marker can be used to determine which balls are closer.
							<br>
						The game continues until 12 points have been scored or to pre-determined points set by the players before the game starts.</strong></p>
						<li>Bocce is played with eight large balls and one smaller target or object ball called a pallina. There are four balls per team and they are made of a different color or pattern to distinguish the balls of one team from those of the other team.</li>

						<br>

						<li>The game is played with two teams, with each team having one, two, or four players. For four player teams, each player throws one ball. For two player teams, each player throws two balls. For one player teams, each player throws four balls. When there are multiple players on a team, a playing rotation is determined at the start of a game and is maintained throughout the entire game.</li>

						<br>

						<li>A game begins with the toss of a coin. The team that wins the coin toss can choose to either have first toss of the pallina or the color of the balls they will use. To start a game, the pallina is rolled or tossed by a member of the team having won the coin toss. A player can toss the pallina any distance as long as it passes the center line of the court and stays within the boundaries of the court. If the player fails to toss the ball properly into play, a member of the opposing team will toss the ball into play. If the opposing team fails to properly toss the pallina into play, the toss reverts to a member of the original team.</li>

						<br>

						<li>The player tossing the pallina must deliver the first ball. If the ball lands outside of the boundaries of the court, that team must roll again until the first ball is put into play. Otherwise, that player steps aside and the opposing team will then deliver their balls until one of its Bocce balls is closer to the pallina or has thrown all its balls. The "nearest ball" rule governs the sequence of thrown balls. The side whose ball is closest to the pallina is called the "in" ball and the opposing side the "out" ball. Whenever a team gets "in", it steps aside and allows the "out" team to deliver. The other team throws until it gets its ball closer (not ties) to the pallina. This continues until both teams have thrown all their Bocce balls. After both teams have exhausted all their balls, a frame is over and points are awarded. The game resumes by teams throwing from the opposite end of the court. The team that was awarded points in the previous frame begins the next frame by tossing the pallina into play.</li>

						<br>

						<li>All balls must be thrown underhanded. A team has the option of rolling, tossing, bouncing, etc. its ball down the court provided it does not go outdide the boundaries of the court or the player does not violate the foul line. The foul line is used to deliver all balls down the court with the intent of getting a ball closer to the pallina, knocking the opponent's ball away from the pallina, or hitting the pallina so that it ends up closer to your team's ball.</li>

						<br>

						<li>A player should not step on or over the foul line before releasing any ball. If a player steps over the foul line, the player will receive one warning. For a player that commits a second foul line infraction, the team fouled against will be awarded points as they were immediately proceeding the foul and the frame will end. The team committing the foul will be awarded no points for the frame. Or, the fouled against team may have the option of declining the penalty and completing the frame.</li>

						<br>

						<li>Any ball that goes outside the boundaries of the court is considered a dead ball and is removed immediately from play until the end of a frame.</li>

						<br>

						<li>At the end of each frame, points will be awarded. Only one team scores in a frame. One point is awarded for each ball that is closer to the pallina than the closest ball of the opposing team. In the event that the closest ball of each team is the same distance from the pallina, no points will be awarded and the pallina returns to the team that delivered it. Only balls which are distinguishably closer to the pallina than any of the opponent's balls are awarded points. All measurements should be made from the center of the pallina to the edge of a Bocce ball. Games are played to 16 points with the first team reaching 16 points being the winner of a game.</li>

				<li><h3>Ladder Golf</h3></li>
					<ol>
						<p><strong>Objective: The object of the game is to wrap your bolas (two golf balls attached by a nylon rope) around the steps of the ladder. The ladder consists of 3 steps, a top (3 points), middle (2 points) and a bottom step (1 point). The player to reach the exact score of 21 first wins the game.</strong></p>

						<li>Prior to game play a line must be set 5 paces from the ladder. This is the called the toss line. The official toss line is 15 feet away but most players measure 5 paces from the game ladder to set the toss line. This allows for a closer toss line for children’s games. Ladder Golf is played in rounds, each round consists of all players tossing 3 bolas</li>

						<br>

						<li>A coin toss is used to decide which player or team will toss first. The first player must toss all 3 bolas before the next player is able to toss his or her bolas. Bolas can be tossed in anyway the player chooses, as long as they are tossed individually and can be bounced off the ground.</li>

						<br>

						<li>The winner of the round earns the first toss in the next round.</li>

						<br>

						<li>Games are played to an exact point total of 21. In order to win, a player must be the only one to score exactly 21 points after the completion of a round. If a player goes over the exact point total, that players points for that round do not count. For example: A player with 18 points needs 3 points to get the exact score of 21 in order to win. If that player has 5 points hanging on the ladder after all the players have tossed all strands, none of those points count and the player will enter the next round with 18 points again needing 3 points to win.</li>

						<br>

						<li>. In the case of a tie, the players that tie will play as many overtime rounds as needed until one player ends a complete round 2 points ahead of the other player. The 2 point rule only applies in overtime rounds. During regular play any player can win as long as that player is the only one to score an exact total of 21 points at the end of that round no matter how many points the other players have.</li>

				<li><h3>Cornhole</h3></li>
					<ol>
						<p><strong>Objective: The game is played between 2 or 4 players with 8 bean bags and 2 two goals. Each goal is placed 27 feet from the other facing the other goal. The first team to reach exactly 21 wins the game. If a team goes over 21, their score is reduced to 11.</strong></p>
						<li>The game is played between two teams standing opposite of one another.</li>

						<br>

						<li>Decide who goes first then take turns throwing bags with your opponent. You throw one bag, then your opponent, then you, then your opponent.</li>

						<br>

						<li>Your feet may not go past the front edge of the board. If they do, a foul is called. In the event of a foul, the throw is forfieted and the player loses that turn.</li>

						<br>

						<li>A tossed bag may not touch the ground. If it hits the ground and bounces up on the board, remove it before any other bags are thrown. If its hanging off the board and touching the ground, remove that as well.</li>

						<br>

						<li>When all 8 bags have been tossed to the other side, add up the score. If you earned the most points in that single round, your team will throw first in the next round.</li>
